# termail
Terminal mail client written in Rust.

# Idea
I've been using mutt-wizard from Luck Smith to check my emails. However, a 
big headache during usage is that it's not easy to setup. I met several issues
during every install. Therefore, I start to write this tool.
Currently it'll simply read maildir and mark message read status.
I plan to implement isync and smtp as well.

# Install
```````````make && make install
```
make && make install
```
